3.2 Determinants and Matrix Inverses
In this section, several theorems about determinants are derived. One consequence of these theorems is
that a square matrix A is invertible if and only if det A 6= 0. Moreover, determinants are used to give a
formula for A−1 which, in turn, yields a formula (called Cramer’s rule) for the solution of any system of
linear equations with an invertible coefficient matrix.
We begin with a remarkable theorem (due to Cauchy in 1812) about the determinant of a product of
matrices. The proof is given at the end of this section
